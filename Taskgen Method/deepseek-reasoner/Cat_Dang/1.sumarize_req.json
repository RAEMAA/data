The system architecture prioritizes unified management of business operations across all branches while providing localized support for branch staff. Waiters utilize handheld digital interfaces to transmit customer orders directly to preparation stations, optimizing workflow efficiency and minimizing physical movement. An automated billing system integrated with POS terminals ensures real-time transaction processing and audit-ready financial records. The platform supports dual-level revenue reporting: branch-specific dashboards enable localized performance monitoring, while a centralized corporate interface aggregates nationwide data for consolidated fiscal analysis, compliance adherence, and strategic resource allocation. This infrastructure maintains operational consistency across the chain while enabling granular oversight of individual branch metrics and enterprise-wide financial trends."
