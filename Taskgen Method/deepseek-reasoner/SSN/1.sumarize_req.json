Students leverage the network to access course-specific materials (e.g., Algebra A1, Method of Report Writing) and evaluate instructors and curricula through ratings and feedback, aiding peers in making informed enrollment decisions aligned with their academic and career objectives. Researchers and educators utilize SSN to share teaching methodologies, collaborate on projects, and identify potential collaborators. The system organizes content through university-specific networks, allowing users to participate in multiple institutional communities simultaneously. Initially targeting Vietnamese universities, the platform is designed to later extend to high schools and elementary schools nationwide, fostering academic connectivity across all education levels."
