The system will feature centralized branch coordination to streamline operations and enable cross-location data analysis for strategic planning. A core component includes real-time online ordering interfaces optimized for office workers, automatically routing orders to the nearest branch for efficient fulfillment. The platform will integrate www.nganluong.vn as the primary payment gateway alongside secondary options, supporting CTC's promotional campaigns through dedicated tracking and redemption tools. A dual customer rating and feedback system will be implemented for service evaluation and quality improvements, coupled with scheduled price updates to maintain menu accuracy and consumer trust. Advanced analytics modules will generate operational dashboards, sales pattern visualizations, and inventory forecasts, aligning with CTC's luxurious service standards and professional operational requirements."
