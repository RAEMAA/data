  "sumarize_req": "This system manages operations for Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm, which maintains 200+ piglets and distributes multiple breeds. It accommodates two user groups: farm staff and registered farmers. Staff oversee piglet development through growth metrics (weight, feeding schedules), environmental monitoring (including temperature), disease tracking, import/export statuses, cross-region transfers, and revenue analytics via operational reports. Administrators configure system settings, veterinarians enforce health protocols, and farmers document daily care. Farmers register accounts to browse available breeds, place orders, and access post-purchase resources like vaccination schedules, feeding guidelines, and direct messaging with staff. Real-time updates track purchased piglets through order workflows encompassing inventory verification, approval chains, logistics coordination, and fulfillment documentation. Health compliance features include symptom monitoring, medication records, automated vaccination reminders, and outbreak alerts. The farm owner publishes promotional content and generates periodic reports (monthly/quarterly/annual) evaluating sales patterns, health statistics, and operational performance. Integrated dashboards visualize productivity metrics, cost analyses, and growth forecasts, while an in-app communication hub enables document sharing and coordinated decision-making between farmers, staff, suppliers, and veterinary partners."
