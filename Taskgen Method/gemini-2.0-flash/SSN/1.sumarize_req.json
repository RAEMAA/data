{"sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a social network for students and \nresearchers to share studying materials, findings, and experiences in learning, \nteaching and research. \nThrough SSN you are able to share your study experience in both art \nand science. With SSN, students can find useful learning information about \nAlgebra A1, Method of Report Writing, and other subjects of study. Students \ncan evaluate and rate teachers and courses via this network. Students can also \nprovide materials and recommendations for each course. This information \nhelps other students to select suitable courses that match their interests, \nstudying and career goals. For researchers and teachers, they can share teaching \nand research experiences. This network is also a place for them to find \npotential students to work with. The initial focus would be on the universities \nin Vietnam. Each university is a network, and thus the materials and \nexperiences are university-based. Of course, one person can join multiple \nnetworks if they are interested in. In the future, the system is expanded to the \nnetwork of high schools and elementary schools in Vietnam."}
