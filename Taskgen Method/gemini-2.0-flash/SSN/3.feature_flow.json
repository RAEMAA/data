      Observation: I have defined the user flows and screens for 'Profile Creation and Management', 'User Authentication and Authorization', and 'Resource Uploading and Sharing' features. I need to define the user flow and screens for the 'Content Tagging and Categorization' feature.
      Thoughts: The 'Content Tagging and Categorization' feature will allow users to tag and categorize shared resources, making it easier for other users to find relevant content. The flow should include steps for adding tags and categories to resources during the upload process, as well as searching and filtering resources by tags and categories. The screens should include a tagging/categorization input field on the upload screen, and search/filter options on the resource browsing screen.
      Subtask identified: Define the user flow and screens for the 'Content Tagging and Categorization' feature. The flow should include steps for adding tags and categories to resources during the upload process, as well as searching and filtering resources by tags and categories. The screens should include a tagging/categorization input field on the upload screen, and search/filter options on the resource browsing screen.
      Getting LLM to perform the following task: Define the user flow and screens for the 'Content Tagging and Categorization' feature. The flow should include steps for adding tags and categories to resources during the upload process, as well as searching and filtering resources by tags and categories. The screens should include a tagging/categorization input field on the upload screen, and search/filter options on the resource browsing screen.
