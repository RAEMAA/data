To streamline operations across its various locations, CDC requires a comprehensive business management system. This system should efficiently manage order taking, automate bill generation, and provide detailed revenue reporting for each branch and the entire chain. The solution needs to cater to the specific needs of different areas within the coffee shop, while also offering robust support for both staff and management in their daily tasks and decision-making processes, minimizing waiter movements and facilitating easy order processing."
