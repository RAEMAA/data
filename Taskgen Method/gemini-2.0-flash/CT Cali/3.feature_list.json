This can be done using:\n    *   **Keyword Matching:** Identifying specific words or phrases that indicate a common inquiry (e.g., \"order status\", \"delivery time\", \"store hours\").\n    *   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Using machine learning models to understand the meaning and intent behind the user's inquiry.\n3. **Intent Recognition:** Based on the analysis, the system identifies the user's intent (e.g., \"check order status\", \"find out delivery time\", \"get store hours\").\n4. **Automated Response Selection:** The system selects the appropriate automated response based on the identified intent. This response can be:\n    *   **Pre-defined Text:** A static message that provides the requested information (e.g., \"Our store hours are 9 AM to 9 PM daily.\").\n    *   **Dynamic Information Retrieval:** Retrieving real-time information from the system (e.g., order status, delivery time) and incorporating it into the response.\n5. **Response Delivery:** The system delivers the automated response to the user via the chat window or contact form.\n6. **Order Status Example:**\n    *   **User Inquiry:** \"What is the status of my order #12345?\"\n    *   **Intent Recognition:** \"check order status\"\n    *   **Dynamic Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves the status of order #12345 from the order management system (e.g., \"Order Confirmed\", \"Preparing\", \"Out for Delivery\", \"Delivered\").\n    *   **Automated Response:** \"Your order #12345 is currently Out for Delivery and is expected to arrive within the next 30 minutes.\"\n7. **Delivery Time Example:**\n    *   **User Inquiry:** \"How long will it take for my order to be delivered?\"\n    *   **Intent Recognition:** \"find out delivery time\"\n    *   **Dynamic Information Retrieval:** The system calculates the estimated delivery time based on current order volume, driver availability, and distance.\n    *   **Automated Response:** \"Your order is estimated to be delivered in approximately 45 minutes.\"\n8. **Store Hours Example:**\n    *   **User Inquiry:** \"What are your store hours?\"\n    *   **Intent Recognition:** \"get store hours\"\n    *   **Pre-defined Text:** The system retrieves the pre-defined store hours.\n    *   **Automated Response:** \"Our store hours are 9 AM to 9 PM daily.\"\n9. **Escalation (Optional):** If the system cannot understand the user's inquiry or provide a satisfactory response, it can escalate the request to a human support agent.",
