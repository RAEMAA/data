{"requirement": "Dream Social Network (DSN) is an online community where members \ncan post their ideas, talk about their dreams, or share moods, individual \nopinions, etc. \nWhen joining the DSN, everyone has a particular space to expose all of \ntheir thinking and feelings such as sadness, happiness, hopelessness, and \nsilliness. The idea behind this network is that, sometimes, we have many ideas \nbut we don\u2019t know how to share them with our friends, how to survey or how \nto get feedback. DSN would help us to share our ideas with everyone around \nthe world. You want to share your sweet dreams and find someone having the \nsimilar dreams? DSN is a good place for that. Maybe you can find someone \nwho has you in his/her dreams. It\u2019s good to get connected in such case, and you \nand that person might become soul mates. You want to share your ideas and \nfind solutions to achieve your ideas? In this network, everyone can see your \nideas and dreams. \nDSN is a good place to remind your dream and to make it come true."}
