The company is targeting the vast farming population in Vietnam and is set to deploy a system called www.hailua.com.vn, which serves as an e-commerce platform. This website allows farmers to register their accounts using their bank accounts and post their produce—ranging from rice and fruits to fish—with comprehensive details such as descriptions, images, and prices. It facilitates transactions by enabling online payments and shipping services, while also offering features for users to compare different products in a manner similar to major e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay. Although the initial version will focus on the fundamental capabilities of posting, selling, and buying produce, additional features may be incorporated in later stages to enhance the user experience."
