  "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a platform designed for students and researchers to exchange study materials, share experiences, and discuss findings related to learning, teaching, and research. It provides an opportunity for users to share their personal experiences in both the arts and sciences. Through SSN, students have access to valuable learning resources on topics ranging from Algebra A1 to report writing techniques, along with the ability to rate and evaluate courses and teachers. They can also contribute materials and suggestions for various courses, aiding peers in selecting courses that align with their interests, educational goals, and future career plans. For researchers and educators, SSN serves as a hub for sharing teaching insights, research experiences, and for connecting with potential students. Initially, the network will focus on universities in Vietnam, where each institution forms its own network based on university-specific experiences and materials, although users can participate in multiple networks. Plans are in place to eventually extend the network to cover high schools and elementary schools across Vietnam."
