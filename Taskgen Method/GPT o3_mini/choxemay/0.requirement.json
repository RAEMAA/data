  "requirment": "Imagine that you have a motorcycle that you want to sell to pay your tuition fees. (Well, sometimes it is not a good solution but you might end up doing so). You want to sell it fast and with a highest possible price. Where would you sell to? Luckily, you can go to the Motorcycle Market, the website to sell and buy motorcycles. On the market, a user can post to notifications to sell or buy motorbikes or parts and accessories for his bike. The way it works should be similar to that of ebay.com. But the difference is that the website is focused on selling and buying motorbikes and parts. The website has to manage the level of creditability for each member. It depends on the number of items successfully exchanged and feedbacked by users, and the cost of all items sold and bought. Posts of the user having a higher level of creditability are displayed before those of lower level of credibility. Motorcycle Market is also a place for everyone to discuss and share experience."
