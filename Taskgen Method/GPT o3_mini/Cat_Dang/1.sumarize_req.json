The luxurious section is ideal for both business meetings and friendly gatherings, while the romantic garden court provides a charming atmosphere for couples. With an expanding network of branches nationwide, CDC has recognized the need for a unified business management system that centralizes information from all locations and assists local staff. This system is designed to streamline operations by facilitating waiter order processing—transmitting orders directly from customers to the preparation room—minimizing staff movement, automating billing processes, and generating comprehensive revenue reports for both individual branches and the entire chain."
