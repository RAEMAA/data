The system is designed to serve two groups of users: the farm’s staff and its farmer customers. Staff members will be able to update detailed records on piglet growth, health, and common diseases, as well as track piglet import-export statuses and revenue statistics. Meanwhile, farmers can register an account to review the various piglet offerings, place orders, and use the system to communicate with the farm regarding proper care practices such as feeding and vaccination procedures. Additionally, the system enables the farm owner to keep information up-to-date, announce promotions, and generate monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, thereby facilitating streamlined management and efficient information exchange."
