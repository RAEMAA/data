  "sumarize_req": "The assigned task involves developing a comprehensive system to manage and monitor various aspects of piglet growth, feeding, temperature, and environmental criteria at Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm. This system must cater to two primary user groups: the farm’s staffs and farmers who are the farm’s customers. The system should enable farm staff to efficiently update information related to piglet growth, health, and common diseases, as well as manage import and export states and revenue statistics. It should also allow farmers to easily register an account on the website, look over all kinds of pig supplied by the farm, order one or many piglets needed, communicate with the farm to ensure proper care of their purchased piglets, and access information about feeding and vaccination procedures. The system must be user-friendly, intuitive, and secure for both groups of users, with seamless integration with existing farm management systems. Furthermore, it should provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for informed decision-making, helping them optimize piglet care and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. The website will also facilitate easy management and updating of information by the farm owner, enabling monthly, quarterly, and annual reports to be generated efficiently."
