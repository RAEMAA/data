The user-friendly interface designed for waiters will significantly enhance their order-taking efficiency and minimize physical movement between the dining area and preparation room, thereby optimizing service delivery and ensuring a seamless experience for customers. The system architecture will integrate business data from multiple branches and local support teams, creating a unified platform for seamless collaboration and informed decision-making. Additionally, the comprehensive database management system will integrate and manage business information from all branches in a structured and secure manner, ensuring data consistency and reliability across the organization by providing real-time updates and historical tracking, thus enabling informed decision-making and efficient operations. The system should also produce bills automatically, allowing CDC to generate and view revenue reports of each local branch and the whole chain."
