This entails identifying and prioritizing functionalities such as user registration, content creation, search capabilities, price comparison tools, and secure online payment and shipping integration. The website will serve as an e-commerce platform where farmers can register an account given they have a bank account and post their produces with descriptions, images, prices, and other related information. Customers can search for products, select them, pay online, and ship to their house, also comparing prices and features of different produces. The initial version will have basic capabilities allowing posting, selling, and buying produces online, with shipping and payment done online as well."
