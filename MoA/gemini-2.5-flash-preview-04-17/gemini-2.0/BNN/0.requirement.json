  "requirment": "Ban Nha Nong (BNN) ltd. is a software development company specializing in developing and maintaining software products and providing software services that promote the application of information technology in rural regions in Vietnam. The market for the company is enormous as the large majority of population in Vietnam is farmers. Now, BNN wants to develop and deploy a system called www.hailua.com.vn. The website is intended to be a place for farmers to sell their produces (rice, fruits, fish, etc.) and for customers to buy farmersâ€™ produces. It is an e-commerce website where any farmer can register an account given they have a bank account and can post their produces with descriptions, images, prices and any other things related to the produces. They can collect the money after their produces are sold. Customers can go to the website, searching for the produce they want, selecting the produce, paying online, and shipping it to their house. They can also compare the prices and features of different produces. Generally, the website is something similar to amazon.com and ebay.com. The company plans to deploy the system in multiple periods. The initial version does not necessarily include all fancy features like those of amazon.com or ebay.com. But it should have basic capabilities allowing posting, selling, and buying produces online. Shipping and payment should be done online as well"
