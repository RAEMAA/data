{    "sumarize_req": "Ban Nha Nong (BNN) Ltd., a software company focused on applying IT in rural Vietnam, is developing www.hailua.com.vn, an e-commerce platform. This site will connect Vietnamese farmers directly with customers, enabling farmers to sell agricultural products (rice, fruits, fish, etc.). Farmers can register (requiring a bank account), list products with details, images, and prices, and receive payments upon sale. Customers can browse, search, compare prices, select, purchase, pay online, and arrange shipping. Modeled generally after platforms like Amazon or eBay, the system will be deployed in phases, with the initial version prioritizing core online capabilities for posting, selling, buying, shipping, and payment."}
