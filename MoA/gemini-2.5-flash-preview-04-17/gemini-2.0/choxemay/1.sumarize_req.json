  "sumarize_req": "The project is to develop an online marketplace called 'Motorcycle Market', specializing in buying and selling motorcycles, parts, and accessories. Functioning similarly to eBay, the platform allows users to post listings. A key feature is a credibility system for members, based on successful transactions, user feedback, and transaction value, which influences the visibility and ranking of listings. The site also includes a forum for community discussion and sharing experiences. The overall goal is to facilitate quick sales at the best possible price within this niche market."
