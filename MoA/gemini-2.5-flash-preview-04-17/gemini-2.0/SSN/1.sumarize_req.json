  "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a social media platform designed for students and researchers/educators to exchange academic resources, research findings, and experiences in learning, teaching, and research across various disciplines. The platform allows students to find learning materials for subjects like Algebra A1 and Report Writing, evaluate and rate courses and instructors, and provide recommendations, aiding them in selecting courses aligned with their interests and career goals. Researchers and educators can share their insights and connect with potential collaborators or students. Initially, SSN will focus on universities in Vietnam, with each university acting as a distinct network that users can join. Future expansion plans include incorporating high schools and elementary schools in Vietnam."
