The system aims to streamline farm operations and improve interactions with farmers, particularly in outlying areas, by facilitating information and piglet exchange. It will cater to two main user groups: Farm staff will use the system to update detailed piglet information (growth, health, diseases), track import/export status, and manage revenue statistics. Farmers, as customers, will be able to register, browse available piglet types, place orders, and communicate with the farm regarding proper piglet care, such as feeding and vaccination procedures. The farm owner will benefit from easy management, access to up-to-date information, the ability to announce promotions, and the generation of essential monthly, quarterly, and annual reports."
