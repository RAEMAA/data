  "sumarize_req": "The project involves developing a management system for Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm, a large supplier of piglets to farmers. The system will allow farm staff to monitor and update detailed information about piglet growth, health, feeding, and environmental conditions, track inventory (import/export), and view revenue statistics. Farmers, as customers, can register accounts, browse available piglets, place orders, and communicate with the farm regarding care and procedures like feeding and vaccination. The system will also assist the farm owner in managing and updating information, announcing promotions, and generating various reports (monthly, quarterly, annual)."
