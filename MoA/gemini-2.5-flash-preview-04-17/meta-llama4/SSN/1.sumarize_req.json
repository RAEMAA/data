  "sumarize_req": "The Study Social Network (SSN) is a social networking platform for students and researchers designed to facilitate the sharing of study materials, findings, and experiences across learning, teaching, and research domains. Users can evaluate and rate teachers and courses, provide material recommendations, and find useful academic information, aiding students in course selection and helping teachers/researchers connect with potential collaborators. Initially targeting universities in Vietnam with university-specific networks that users can join, the platform plans future expansion to include high schools and elementary schools."
