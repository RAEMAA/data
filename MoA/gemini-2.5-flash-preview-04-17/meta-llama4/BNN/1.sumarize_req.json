Key features include farmer registration, product posting (description, images, price), online payment processing for both sellers and buyers, and shipping arrangements. The system aims to function like a platform similar to Amazon or eBay for farm produce. Deployment will be phased, with the initial version focusing on essential capabilities like online posting, selling, buying, payment, and shipping."
