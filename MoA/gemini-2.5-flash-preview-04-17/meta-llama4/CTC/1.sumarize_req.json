The system will feature a website allowing customers to easily browse the menu, place food orders, and have them automatically transferred to the nearest branch. Key customer functionalities include tracking and applying promotions, secure online payment integration (e.g., nganluong.vn), providing feedback, and rating the restaurant. The website must display regularly updated and accurate prices. This online platform is intended to introduce a new broken rice delivery service specifically targeting the high demand from office workers. For management, the system will enable efficient handling of all branches, facilitate menu and promotion updates, and provide robust data analysis capabilities to support business decisions and strategies."
