    "sumarize_req": "The project involves developing a website named Motorcycle Market, designed as a platform for users to buy and sell motorcycles, parts, and accessories, similar to ebay.com but focused on motorcycles. Key features include the ability for users to post sale or purchase notifications, a credibility system for members based on successful transactions, user feedback, and the total cost of items exchanged, and the prioritization of posts from users with higher credibility. The site will also function as a forum for discussion and experience sharing among motorcycle enthusiasts."
