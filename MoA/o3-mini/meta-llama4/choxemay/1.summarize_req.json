    "sumarize_req": "The project involves creating a specialized online marketplace called 'Motorcycle Market' for users to buy and sell motorcycles, parts, and accessories. Similar to eBay, it allows users to post sale and purchase listings. A key feature is a user credibility system based on successful transactions, user feedback, and the total value of items exchanged. Listings from users with higher credibility levels are prioritized and displayed first. The platform also serves as a community forum for discussion and sharing experiences among motorcycle enthusiasts, aiming to help users sell their items quickly and at a high price."
