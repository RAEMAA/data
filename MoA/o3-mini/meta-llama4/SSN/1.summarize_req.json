    "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a platform designed for students and researchers to share study materials, findings, and experiences related to learning, teaching, and research across various subjects in both art and science. Students can find useful information on subjects like Algebra A1 and Method of Report Writing, evaluate and rate teachers and courses, and provide recommendations to help other students select suitable courses. Researchers and teachers can share their experiences and connect with potential students. The platform initially focuses on universities in Vietnam, with each university functioning as a distinct network, although users can join multiple networks. Future plans include expanding the system to include high schools and elementary schools in Vietnam."
