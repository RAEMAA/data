This system will monitor and manage the growth, feeding, temperature, and environmental criteria for each specific type of piglet. It serves two main user groups: Farm Staff and Farmers. Farm Staff will use the system to update information regarding piglet growth, health, and common diseases, manage import and export statuses, and handle revenue statistics. Farmers, acting as customers, can register accounts to browse the available piglet types, place orders, and utilize the system for post-purchase communication and guidance on proper raising techniques, including feeding and vaccination procedures. The system also enables the farm owner to easily manage and update information, announce promotions, and generate monthly, quarterly, and annual reports."
