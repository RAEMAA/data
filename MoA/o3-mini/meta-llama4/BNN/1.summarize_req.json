The website aims to connect Vietnamese farmers with customers, allowing farmers to sell their produce (rice, fruits, fish, etc.) and customers to buy online. Farmers can register accounts (requiring a bank account) and post products with descriptions, images, and prices, collecting payment after sales. Customers can browse, compare, select, pay online, and have products shipped to their homes. The system is envisioned to be similar to platforms like Amazon and eBay. The initial deployment phase will focus on basic capabilities, including registration, product posting, online payment, and shipping, while more advanced features will be developed in subsequent phases."
