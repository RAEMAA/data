    "sumarize_req": "Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm, a major supplier with over 200 piglets, aims to develop a comprehensive system that manages and monitors various parameters for different types of piglets. The system will track growth, feeding, temperature, environmental conditions, and health issues (including common diseases) for each piglet category. It supports two user groups: farm staff and farmers. Farm staff can update piglet information, record import/export data, track revenue statistics, and monitor overall piglet wellbeing. Farmers, as registered users, can browse the available piglets, place orders, and communicate with the farm regarding essential services such as feeding and vaccination procedures. Additionally, the system empowers the farm owner with administrative tools to maintain up-to-date information, post promotional announcements, and generate detailed monthly, quarterly, and annual reports."
