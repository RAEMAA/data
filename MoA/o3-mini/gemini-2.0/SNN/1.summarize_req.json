    "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a platform for students, researchers, and teachers to share academic resources, research findings, and experiences in learning, teaching, and research across various disciplines (arts and sciences). Students can access study materials, evaluate and rate courses and instructors, and provide recommendations to help others choose suitable courses aligned with their interests and career goals. Researchers and teachers can share expertise and connect with potential collaborators. Initially focusing on Vietnamese universities, with university-specific networks, the platform allows users to participate in multiple networks. Future plans include expanding to include high schools and elementary schools in Vietnam."
