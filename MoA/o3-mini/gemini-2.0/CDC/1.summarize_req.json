As CDC has expanded into a nationwide chain with multiple branches, there is a need for a comprehensive business management system. The purpose of the system is to consolidate and manage business information from all locations and assist local staff. Key functionalities include enabling waiters to efficiently take and transmit orders to the preparation room, automating bill generation, and providing detailed revenue reports for each branch as well as the entire chain."
