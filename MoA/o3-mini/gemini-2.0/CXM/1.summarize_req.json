    "project_summary": "The Motorcycle Market project is an online marketplace exclusively focused on motorcycles and related parts/accessories. It is designed specifically for users who want to buy or sell motorbikes quickly and at the best possible price, similar to eBay's model but with a niche focus. Users can post notifications for selling or buying motorcycles, parts, and accessories. The platform features a credibility system that assesses members based on the number of successful transactions, user feedback, and the total value of items traded. As a result, listings from users with higher credibility are displayed more prominently than those from lower-credibility members. Additionally, the website serves as a community space where motorcycle enthusiasts can discuss, share experiences, and exchange advice."
