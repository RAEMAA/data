  "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a platform designed for students and researchers to exchange educational materials, insights, and personal experiences in learning, teaching, and research. The network enables users to share their academic journeys across various disciplines, including both arts and sciences. It provides access to valuable study resources on subjects such as Algebra A1 and Method of Report Writing, among others, while also allowing students to rate educators and courses. Additionally, students can offer course materials and recommendations, which assist others in choosing educational paths that align with their interests and career goals. For researchers and teachers, SSN offers a space to share their professional experiences and find potential student collaborators. Initially, the focus is on Vietnamese universities, where each institution forms its own network, yet individuals have the option to join multiple networks if desired. Future plans include expanding the system to incorporate high schools and elementary schools across Vietnam."
