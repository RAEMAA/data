  "sumarize_req": "Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm is a large-scale operation that offers various types of piglets to farmers. With over 200 piglets currently under its care, the farm owner plans to develop a comprehensive system to track and manage key aspects of piglet care, including growth, feeding, temperature, and environmental conditions. This system is also aimed at helping farmers in outlying regions easily access information and facilitate piglet exchanges. There are two main groups of users for the website. The first group consists of farm staff who will update details on piglet growth, health records, common diseases, import/export statuses, and revenue statistics. The second group is made up of the farmers themselves, who can register to browse the available pig varieties and place orders for one or more piglets. After a purchase, the system serves as a communication platform to ensure that proper care, such as feeding and vaccination routines, is maintained. Additionally, the farm owner can use this system to keep data current, announce promotional offers, and generate monthly, quarterly, and annual reports."
