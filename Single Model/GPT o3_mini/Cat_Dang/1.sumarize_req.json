The luxurious section is perfect for business discussions and casual meetups with friends, while the romantic garden court offers a charming setting for couples. As a well-known brand of Én Bạc Co., Ltd, CDC has grown into a vast network with numerous branches nationwide, creating a need for a centralized business management system. This system will integrate and manage operational data from all branches and assist local staff. It aims to simplify processes for waiters by streamlining order taking, transferring orders to the prep area, and automatically generating bills, thereby reducing unnecessary movement. Moreover, the system will enable the company to generate and review detailed revenue reports for each branch as well as the entire chain."
