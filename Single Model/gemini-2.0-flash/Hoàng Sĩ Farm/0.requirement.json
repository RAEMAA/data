    "requirment": "Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm is a big farm that supplies different kinds of piglets (young pigs) to farmers. Currently, the farm has over 200 piglets. The farm owner wants to develop a system to manage and monitor the growth, feeding, temperature and environmental criteria for each kind of piglet. The system also helps farmers easily keep information and exchange piglets in outlying areas. The website has two groups of users. The first one is the farm’s staffs. They should be able to update the information for growth, health and common diseases for each kind of pigs, import and export states, and revenue statistics. The second user group is farmers who are the farm’s customers. They can register an account on the system to look over all kinds of pig supplied by the farm, and order one or many piglets needed. After buying the piglet, the farmer uses the system to communicate with the farm to make sure that the piglet is properly raised. Feeding and vaccination procedures, for example, are also managed and communicated via the system. The farm owner can easily manage, keep the information up-to-date, and announce promotions. The website is useful for owner to make monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. "}
