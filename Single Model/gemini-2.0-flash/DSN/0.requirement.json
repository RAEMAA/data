  "requirement": "Dream Social Network (DSN) is an online community where members can post their ideas, talk about their dreams, or share moods, individual opinions, etc. When joining the DSN, everyone has a particular space to expose all of their thinking and feelings such as sadness, happiness, hopelessness, and silliness. The idea behind this network is that, sometimes, we have many ideas but we dont know how to share them with our friends, how to survey or how to get feedback. DSN would help us to share our ideas with everyone around the world. You want to share your sweet dreams and find someone having the similar dreams? DSN is a good place for that. Maybe you can find someone who has you in his/her dreams. Its good to get connected in such case, and you and that person might become soul mates. You want to share your ideas and find solutions to achieve your ideas? In this network, everyone can see your ideas and dreams. DSN is a good place to remind your dream and to make it come true."
