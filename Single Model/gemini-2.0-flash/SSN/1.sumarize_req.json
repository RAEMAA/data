  "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a social network for students and researchers to share studying materials, findings, and experiences in learning, teaching and research. Through SSN you are able to share your study experience in both art and science. With SSN, students can find useful learning information about Algebra A1, Method of Report Writing, and other subjects of study. Students can evaluate and rate teachers and courses via this network. Students can also provide materials and recommendations for each course. This information helps other students to select suitable courses that match their interests, studying and career goals. For researchers and teachers, they can share teaching and research experiences. This network is also a place for them to find potential students to work with. The initial focus would be on the universities in Vietnam. Each university is a network, and thus the materials and experiences are university-based. Of course, one person can join multiple networks if they are interested in. In the future, the system is expanded to the network of high schools and elementary schools in Vietnam."
