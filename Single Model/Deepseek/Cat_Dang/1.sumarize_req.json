As the brand has expanded into a multi-branch nationwide chain, there is a growing need for a centralized system to streamline business management across all locations. This system aims to integrate data from every branch, support local staff operations, and enhance efficiency. Waiters can input drink orders digitally, reducing physical movement and ensuring quick delivery to the preparation team, while automated billing simplifies transactions. Additionally, the system enables comprehensive revenue tracking, allowing the company to generate detailed reports for individual branches or the entire network, fostering informed decision-making and unified oversight."
