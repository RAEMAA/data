With a vast potential market due to Vietnam’s predominantly agricultural population, the company aims to launch www.hailua.com.vn, an e-commerce platform connecting farmers directly with buyers. This website will enable farmers with bank accounts to register, list agricultural products (e.g., rice, fruits, fish), and include details like descriptions, images, and pricing. Customers can browse, compare, purchase, and pay for goods online, with items shipped to their addresses. While inspired by platforms like Amazon and eBay, the initial phase prioritizes core functionalities—product listings, sales, online transactions, and shipping—without advanced features. BNN plans to roll out the system incrementally, ensuring foundational operations are streamlined to support rural economic growth through digital access."
