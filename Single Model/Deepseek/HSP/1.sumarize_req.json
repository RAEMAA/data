  "sumarize_req": "Hoàng Sĩ Pig Farm is a large-scale operation specializing in providing farmers with diverse breeds of piglets, currently housing over 200 young pigs. The farm aims to implement a comprehensive management system to track and oversee the growth, feeding regimens, temperature conditions, and environmental factors for each piglet type. This system will also facilitate efficient record-keeping and enable piglet exchanges for farmers in remote regions. The platform caters to two user groups: farm staff and customer farmers. Staff members can input and update data on pig health, growth metrics, common diseases, import-export activities, and revenue analytics. Farmers, after creating accounts, can browse available piglet breeds, place orders, and use the system post-purchase to coordinate with the farm on proper care practices, including feeding schedules and vaccination protocols. Additionally, the system allows the farm owner to maintain updated records, share promotional announcements, and generate detailed monthly, quarterly, and annual reports for strategic decision-making."
