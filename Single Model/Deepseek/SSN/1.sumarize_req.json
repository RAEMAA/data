  "sumarize_req": "Study Social Network (SSN) is a digital platform designed to connect students and researchers, enabling them to exchange educational resources, insights, and experiences related to learning, teaching, and academic exploration. The network supports sharing expertise in both scientific and artistic disciplines, offering access to study materials for subjects like Algebra A1, Report Writing, and more. Students can assess and rate courses and instructors, contribute resources, and provide recommendations to help peers choose courses aligned with their academic interests and career aspirations. Researchers and educators can collaborate by sharing teaching methodologies, research findings, and identifying potential student collaborators. Initially targeting universities in Vietnam, SSN organizes content and interactions within individual university-based networks, though users may join multiple institutions' networks. Future plans include expanding the platform to include high schools and elementary schools across Vietnam, broadening its educational impact."
